# starting the build of simualtion for game of life
# understanding the Conceptual visualization of toroidal boundary conditions
# Conwayâ€™s Game of Life has four rules.
# 1. If a cell is ON and has fewer than two neighbors that are ON, it turns OFF.
# 2. If a cell is ON and has either two or three neighbors that are ON, it remains ON.
# 3. If a cell is ON and has more than three neighbors that are ON, it turns OFF.
# 4. If a cell is OFF and has exactly three neighbors that are ON, it turns ON.
